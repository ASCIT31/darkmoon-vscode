## Screenshots

Rendered from the bundled synthetic **Demo Shop** fixtures (`demo-shop.local`) with the extension's own webview HTML/CSS/JS and its real redaction logic — no mock data.

**Vulnerabilities** — filter by severity/status, free-text search and column sort:

**Finding detail (redacted by default)** — description, evidence and remediation with sensitive values masked until you explicitly reveal them on a local workbench:

![Finding detail, redacted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ASCIT31/darkmoon-vscode/master/docs/screenshots/vscode-finding-redacted.png)

**Finding detail (revealed)** — after the local, confirmed *Reveal real values* action:

## Install

- **Marketplace:** search for **Darkmoon** in the Extensions view and click Install.
- **From VSIX:** `code --install-extension darkmoon-vscode-0.1.0.vsix` (or Extensions view → `...` → *Install from VSIX…*).

## Connect

Open Settings and pick your edition with `darkmoon.mode`:

- **OSS** — set `darkmoon.dataDir` to your Darkmoon settings directory (the tree that holds `campaigns/` and `vulnerabilities/`). Reports are read from `<dataDir>/reports` by default; set `darkmoon.cliPath` to `darkmoon.sh` if you want to launch campaigns from the editor.
- **Pro** — set `darkmoon.baseUrl` to your Pro API (`https://…`, with or without `/api/v1`) and store your JWT via **Darkmoon: Set Pro API Token**.

Then run **Darkmoon: Refresh**. Want a no-backend preview first? Toggle `darkmoon.dev.useFixtures` to load the bundled synthetic *Demo Shop* sample data.

## Use

1. **View findings** — open the **Campaigns** tree (status, overall risk, severity breakdown, agents) and the **Vulnerabilities** table (filter by severity/status, search, sort).
2. **Open a finding** — click a row to see description, redacted evidence and remediation.
3. **Open a report** — **Darkmoon: Open Report** shows the redacted Markdown; **Darkmoon: Open Full Report** reveals real values (local, non-remote workbench only, with a confirmation).

> **CI pass/fail is not decided here.** This extension is browse-only; the findings-based fail policy (`--fail-on`) lives in the `darkmoon-ci` CLI and the CI/CD integrations (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins).

## Features

- **Campaigns** — a tree of your campaigns with status, overall risk, severity breakdown, dispatched agents and their findings.
- **Vulnerabilities** — a rich table with **filter** (severity, status), **search** and **column sort** (severity, title/type, target/component, status, campaign).
- **Finding detail** — description, evidence (commands, request/response, logs) and remediation.
- **Reports** — Markdown preview of assessment reports.
- **Launch campaign** — start an assessment against a target you are authorised to test.

## Privacy & safety

- Reports and findings are shown **redacted by default**. Real infrastructure values (IPs, hosts, credentials, tokens) are revealed only on an **explicit, local** action, and never over a remote/untrusted workbench.
- Tokens and license keys are stored in the OS secret store (VS Code **SecretStorage**), never in `settings.json` and never logged.
- Webviews run under a strict Content-Security-Policy with no remote content.

## Capability boundary (OSS vs Pro)

Some capabilities are Pro-only and are hidden/disabled automatically on OSS (e.g. live status of running campaigns, the hosted web dashboard). This extension does **not** include an infrastructure graph or any automated pull-request feature.

## Configuration

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `darkmoon.mode` | `auto` \| `oss` \| `pro` |
| `darkmoon.baseUrl` | Pro REST base URL (use `https`) |
| `darkmoon.dataDir` | OSS artifacts directory (reports are read from `<dataDir>/reports`) |
| `darkmoon.cliPath` | OSS CLI entrypoint (for launching campaigns) |
| `darkmoon.reports.redactByDefault` | Redact sensitive values until revealed |
| `darkmoon.dev.useFixtures` | Demo mode with bundled sample data |

Set secrets via the commands **Darkmoon: Set Pro API Token** and **Darkmoon: Set License Key**.

## Development

```bash
